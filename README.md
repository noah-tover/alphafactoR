This library specializes in convenient creation and scoring of financial factor data for the purpose of analysis. It includes non parametric scoring options, weighted scoring options, and traditional methods such as quantized scores. 

Planned Additions:
1) Improve unit tests and push to master branch.
2) Add realistic trading simulation function.
3) Add a regression scoring method.
4) Add an analysis function for common factor analyses all at once (violin plots, turnover statistics, etc..)
5) Expand upon weighting functionality and compatibility.
6) Integrate with quantstrat for backtesting of signal based strategies on top and bottom scoring assets.
